# About Me

__Professionally__, I am a software developer and entrepreneur with a keen
interest in reducing complexity with over 30 years of professional experience.

I am the founder of [Omnigres](https://omnigres.com), where we aspire to radically
improve the way business systems are built using data-native architecture by turning Postgres into an application runtime.

I have been involved in [open source](opensource) for a long time.

??? question "Which programming languages do I use?"

    These days, I write a lot of ==C/C++== and ==PL/pgSQL==. I have a fairly good command of ==Rust==. I ocassionally use ==OCaml== and ==Prolog/Logtalk==.

    I like languages that change or augment the way I think about programming.

    That being said, I know a lot of other languages (to varying degrees of competency), such as: JavaScript, Ruby, [Zig](https://ziglang.org), Java, Python, etc.

__In personal life__, I am a husband and a father of one amazing daughter. I enjoy running, skiing, cycling and outdoors in general. Trying to figure out
sailing.
